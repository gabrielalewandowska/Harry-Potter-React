# Lab

Practise what we've learned in the past few days by making a small React app. This could be similar to the countries app we made that has a dropdown menu which when selected displays some information about that option. You could also select from a list of api's below or be creative and make something of your choice.

This will be a pairing exercise. Remember to take turns coding every so often.

Also remember to have a container and component folder. Containers will handle data requests, state changes and callbacks. Components will handle visualation logic (and only have access to props).
